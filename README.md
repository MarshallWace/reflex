# Reflex

> Reactive language toolkit

## What is Reflex?

Reflex is an experimental toolkit for the development of [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) languages.

In practical terms, Reflex provides the [ReflexJS](./reflex-js) reactive language syntax, which can be used with the [Reflex Server](./reflex-server) runtime for rapid development of subscription-based GraphQL API services.

## Getting started

There are currently two out-of-the-box runtime environments for getting started with Reflex:

- [`reflex-cli`](./reflex-cli): Reflex REPL environment and standalone script runner ([examples](./reflex-cli/examples))
- [`reflex-server`](./reflex-server): Subscription-based GraphQL Reflex server implementation ([examples](./reflex-server/examples))

Both runtimes support the following syntax:

- [`reflex-js`](./reflex-js): JavaScript syntax for Reflex
